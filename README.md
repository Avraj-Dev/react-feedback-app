# Feedback Application

This is the first big project I'm working on while learning React.

Full transparency, the design is similar to the course I'm learning it from (React Front to Back 2022 by Traversy Media). However, I have done some things differently as well as implement some of my own features while learning.

With this project I have learnt (so far...):

- JSX
- How Components work
- React hooks (useState & useEffect)
- Props (+setting default props, prop types) and prop drilling
- Events (onClick, onChange)
- Lists and keys

# Usage
